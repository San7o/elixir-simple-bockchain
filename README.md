# elixir-simple-blockchain

## Project Statement

This project aims to create a simple block chain in elixir.
The application must be able to:
- Create a block.
- Add the data (header and body) to the block.
- Hash the block.
- Chain the blocks together.

Later on, more advanced features might be added like proof-of-stake and a web-ui.
